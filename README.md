## EaglercraftX Desktop Runtime
Desktop client for Eagler 1.8.8-u19. Server has to run locally on user's PC (with AutoEagler) if you want to play "singleplayer".

To play this, you will need to download the repo and launch the jar file in the main directory to play. Of course you need a server as there is no singleplayer, so look into AutoEagler or join an EaglercraftX 1.8.8 server hosted elsewhere.

You need to have the latest java AND the latest JDK installed on your computer to run this. It will not run without JDK! (if it throws errors about lwjgl libraties not found its most certainly a JDK issue. Make sure you have it.)

This version now works on Linux.
