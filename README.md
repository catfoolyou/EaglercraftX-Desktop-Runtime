## EaglercraftX Desktop Runtime
Desktop client for Eagler 1.8.8-u19. Server has to run locally on user's PC (with AutoEagler) if you want to play "singleplayer".

To play this, you will need to download the repo and launch the jar file in the main directory to play. Of course you need a server as there is no singleplayer, so look into AutoEagler or join an EaglercraftX 1.8.8 server hosted elsewhere.
